Since the first research meeting, I have found some direction. I am looking at using evolutionary programming and genetic algorithms to detect malware. So far "looking at" means reading as many papers on the subject as I can find. I want to learn as much as I can about different approaches, while also making sure I'm not duplicating effort. I believe this is the same path that the graduate student that's under the same professor as I am is taking, so hopefully I can work with him soon so I can start working on something concrete.
