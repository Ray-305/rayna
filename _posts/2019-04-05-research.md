In the past couple of weeks I've been able to wrap up a lot of things. I've been running my code on a larger sample dataset and seeing some promising results! Dr. Ralescu wants me to submit a paper to NAECON, an Aerospace Engineering conference, which is exciting and stressful. I'd love to get published, but I've never written a paper before and I'm concerned that even though I have some results, they're not promising enough or concrete enough... We'll see though! The deadline to submit is in a little over a week.


I also got the distance metric working on small sample data, which is pretty exciting. There are some big changes to make to get it to work on a large dataset, but if I could get that done in time I think it would be a nice addition to my paper.
