This week I had the first meeting to discuss my new research project. I am on a team of graduate and undergraduate students, professors, and Air Force employees. We are working on a grant from the Air Force to take ideas from biology about how bacteria discovers and fights viruses and apply that to computer viruses. 

The first meeting was less directed than I had hoped. I am coming in at the very beginning of the project, so most of the work is still brainstorming. At the moment I'm at a loss of how to get started, but the professor I'm working under sent out a couple of research papers that I'll read to hopefully get an idea of what I need to do!
