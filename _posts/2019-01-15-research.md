Back from winter break! At the end of last semester Dr. Ralescu and I settled on a concrete project for me to do. The idea is to take each opcode in a program's assembly code and assign it an x and y component, and graph the result. This is based off of a similar thing that was done for DNA, so it fits within the grant's goal of taking ideas from biology. In the DNA results, the authors of the paper were able to see that DNA from similar organisms created similar graphs, so hopefully we can see that similar malware programs produce similar graphs!
