Today was another full-team meeting with all the professors and students working on the grant, as well as the Air Force representatives. Each of the graduate students got to present on their ideas and their progress so far, and there was a lot of discussion on how these approaches aligned with the overall goals of the project, what tweaks might need to be made, and other ideas to explore. Unfortunately I had to leave the meeting about halfway through to go to class, so I missed quite a bit, but it was very beneficial to me to be able to sit down with everyone and outline the goals again.

One takeaway I had from the meeting is that there is not enough communication between the different groups. It seems like there has been a lot of duplicated effort, and only a small subset of the project's goals is currently being focused on. I think that most people saw these problems too, so hopefully there is more communication moving forward.
