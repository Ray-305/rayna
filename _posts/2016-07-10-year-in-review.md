This year was a lot more relaxing than freshman year. I did not have to adapt to a huge life change, so I was able to focus more on my academics and work. I started the academic year with my first rotation of co-op at Siemens PLM Software. It was a great experience and I made a lot of good friends there. Although I enjoyed my work experience, I discovered that NX quality assurance is not what I want to work on for the rest of my life. It further solidified my desire to be a software engineer.  

Other significant events that occurred this year are the two Hackathons I participated in. The first one was through my employer. My team created an app that took a picture of 2D geometry, uploaded it to Google Drive, and from there the file opened in NX and the 2D photo was extruded to 3D geometry. We got Honorable Mention for this project. The following class semester, I participated in Revolution UC with some friends I made at work, and I had a blast. We created a Group Me bot that returned memes in the chat whenever anyone typed “Memebot.” I learned Python during this Hackathon, which has become very useful for my current semester of co-op, as one of my assignments is converting C++ tests to Python.  

This upcoming year, I will use my past experiences with Hackathons to help organize Revolution UC. I’m really looking forward to the experience this will provide, and to doing my best to create a space that meets everyone’s needs and brings out everyone’s creativity. Going along with this, one of my goals for next year is to make a lot of great connections through Revolution UC. I will be working on the sponsorship team, reaching out to companies for support for our Hackathon. I will be in contact with employees of a lot of tech companies, which could greatly benefit my future.  

Going into my third year, I would like to advise myself to relax a little more. I tend to get very stressed out over homework and exams, but I need to remind myself that all I can do is my best, and that I will be fine even if I don’t get an A.  

Overall I had a great year and I am really looking forward to my upcoming semesters. I will be taking more coding classes, and my next rotation of coop will be with a different team within Siemens. I have high hopes for my academic and professional development.
