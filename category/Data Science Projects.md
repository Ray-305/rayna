## Data Science Projects

**Predicting states with high traffic fatalities in the United States**

*Abstract- Traffic fatalities in the United States have been the highest as compared to most highincome countries. The objective of the current study is to examine the correlates of traffic fatalities in the U.S. and identify groups of states that display higher traffic fatality using statistical clustering techniques. Further, I also try to see the incidence of traffic fatality in the statistical clusters to further validate my results. This project is a multivariate statistical exploration and informs important policy action plan.*

**Project on Bootstrap Regression**

*Abstract- Bootstrapping is a non-parametric technique that does not require distributional assumptions (such as normally distributed errors),and can provide more accurate inferences when the data are not well behaved or when the sample size is small. The goal of this study is to examine whether a bootstrap regression gives similar parameters (beta estimate and standard errors) as compared to a simple linear regression using the UCLA Graduate Dataset. I used the open source UCLA Graduate Dataset which was available on Kaggle for this study. For this study, we implemented two steps- 1) Perform a linear regression and a Bootstrap regression on the same dataset 2) Compare the model parameters in the two cases.*
