I worked with one of the largest inter-organizational datasets, with a focus on translating network data to practice. Alongside a team of other interns, I worked on the PCN App that was built to tackle the almost impossible â€“ understanding the social connectedness of people so we can identify gaps and fill them with resources, based on a philosophy of building personal resilience and a belief that people want to help themselves.
