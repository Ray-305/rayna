## Graduate Assistant-Data Science at Office of Institutional Research- 

## Survey Design Consultant- [Social and Economic Sciences Research Center](https://sesrc.wsu.edu/) at WSU (Jan 2020-present) 

My work as a survey design consultant includes providing guidance on every step of a survey project, from project management to questionnaire design, survey administration, data analysis and reporting. 

## Network Science Fellow- [Visible Network Labs](https://visiblenetworklabs.com/network-science-fellowship/) (May. 2018 - Aug 2018)

I worked with one of the largest inter-organizational datasets, with a focus on translating network data to practice. Alongside a team of other interns, I worked on the PCN App that was built to tackle the almost impossible â€“ understanding the social connectedness of people so we can identify gaps and fill them with resources, based on a philosophy of building personal resilience and a belief that people want to help themselves.
