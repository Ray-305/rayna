I worked with one of the largest inter-organizational datasets, with a focus on translating network data to practice. Alongside a team of other interns, I worked on the PCN App that was built to tackle the almost impossible â€“ understanding the social connectedness of people so we can identify gaps and fill them with resources, based on a philosophy of building personal resilience and a belief that people want to help themselves. I worked on multiple projects and handled multiple data sets, but what stood out was understanding the importance of social connectedness on mental health. Mental health is essentially embedded in our personal networks, however, getting access to the personal network data of an individual is hard.  I worked with other interns on arriving at certain predictive features from the network data that impacts mental well-being. The insights I gleaned from the data, made way for additional questions on the PCN App which captured the quality of relationships.
