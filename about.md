My name is Namrata Ray. I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Sociology and M.S. in Statistics at Washington State University. I am a social demographer and data scientist. For my research, I specialize in incorporating unique methods to tackle social problems to better understand complex social phenomena, combining appropriate statistical techniques with demographic methods and perspectives. My research is driven by my belief that data has the implicit power to change lives- for good. My research focuses on important real-world issues that affect real people. 

Before starting my doctoral studies at Washington State University, I received a B.S. in Economics from Presidency College (India) and a M.S. in Demography from International Institute for Population Sciences (India).
