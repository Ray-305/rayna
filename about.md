My name is Laura Tebben and I am a backend developer at IBM. I work on IBM Cloud's authentication service, App ID. App ID is an easy-to-use service that allows developers to quickly add authentication to their applications without having to worry about coding or security on their end. 

I love coding, cats, fishkeeping, traveling, and spending time with friends. In my free time I am team captain of a social volleyball team, and I like to work on personal programming projects. You can see my work on my github page: [github.com/ltebben](https://github.com/ltebben).

I graduated 1st in my class this past May from the University of Cincinnati with a B.S. in computer science and a minor in mathematics. I was heavily involved in ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and was the treasurer for their sister organization ACM-W. I worked with ACM throughout the year to organize RevolutionUC, UC's student-run hackathon. I also have a lot of internship experience through college. I completed my 3 co-op rotations (12 months) at Siemens PLM Software, where I was a developer on the UI team for their CAD software, NX. I was also a Digital Technology Intern for GE Digital from August 2017 to August 2018. At GE Digital, I created APIs, wrote automation scripts, and maintained a handful of applications' backends. During class semesters, I TA'd for Engineering Models I and II, the freshman engineering courses that introduce students to programming. In my senior year, I researched computer security and program visualization with Dr. Anca Ralescu, culminating in a paper published to the NAECON Conference.
