My name is Laura Tebben and I am a senior studying computer science with a minor in mathematics at the University of Cincinnati, set to graduate in May 2019. I am a 4.0 student and a member of the University Honors Program. I am involved in ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and am the treasurer for their sister organization ACM-W. I work with ACM throughout the year to organize RevolutionUC, the University's student-run hackathon.

I love coding, cats, traveling, and spending time with friends. In my free time I work on personal programming projects and attend hackathons. You can see my work on my github page: [github.com/ltebben](https://github.com/ltebben). I completed my first 3 co-op rotations at Siemens PLM Software, where I was a developer on the UI team of their CAD software, NX, and did quality assurance for the drafting department. I have been a Digital Technology Intern for GE Digital since August 2017, where I create APIs, write automation scripts, and maintain our application's backend. During class semesters, I TA'd for Models I and Models II, the freshan engineering courses that introduce students to MATLAB. For my senior year, I will be researching computer security with Dr. Anca Ralescu.

I am excited about all the opportunities UC has given me. Co-op has been a great experience and it has given me very high hopes for my future. While I'm still not 100% sure where I want to end up, I know I'd love to be a software engineer for a cutting-edge tech company.
