My name is Laura Tebben and I am a senior studying computer science with a minor in mathematics at the University of Cincinnati, set to graduate in May 2019. I am a 4.0 student and a member of the University Honors Program. I am involved in ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and am the treasurer for their sister organization ACM-W. I work with ACM throughout the year to organize RevolutionUC, UC's student-run hackathon.

I love coding, cats, fishkeeping, traveling, and spending time with friends. In my free time I work on personal programming projects and attend hackathons. You can see my work on my github page: [github.com/ltebben](https://github.com/ltebben). I completed my first 3 co-op rotations at Siemens PLM Software, where I was a developer on the UI team for their CAD software, NX. I was a Digital Technology Intern for GE Digital from August 2017 to August 2018. At GE Digital, I created APIs, wrote automation scripts, and maintained a handful of applications' backends. During class semesters, I TA'd for Engineering Models I and II, the freshan engineering courses that introduce students to programming. In my senior year, I am researching computer security with Dr. Anca Ralescu.

I am happy about all the opportunities UC has given me. Co-op was a great experience and it gave me very high hopes for my future. While I'm still not 100% sure where I want to end up, I know I'd love to be a software engineer for a cutting-edge tech company.
